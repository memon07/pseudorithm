## Hashed list Search

It is a search in which a key through an alorithmic function determinses the location of the list.<br/>
If we are using an array ,we use a hashing algorthim to transform the key into the index that contains the data we need to locate.<br/>

The population of the keys for a hashed list is greater than the storage area used to store the data.<br/>

because there are many keys for each index location in the array,there are chances that one element will hash to the same location in the array<br/>

Set of keys hash to the same location is called as synonyms.<br/>if the list have two or more synonyms then we <br/>will have collisions.
