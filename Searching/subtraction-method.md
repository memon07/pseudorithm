## Subtraction method

Sometimes we have keys that are consecutive but does not starts from one <br/>
for example , a company has 100 employees but the employee id starts from 1000 to 1100<br/> 

In this method we will use a hashing function that subtracts 1000 from the key to determine the address.<br/>

This method is simple and it also guarantees that there will be no collisions.limitation are same as direct hashing<br/>we can only use this method for small number of list.
