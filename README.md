Measuring algorithm's efficiency
## Big-O Notation

If we want to measure the efficiency between two algorithms in which one has 25 iterations and other has 45 iterations, we won't be able to differentiate as both will be executed fast.

But if one iterates 10 times and the other 1000 times then we create some measurements to check the eficiency.

>>> text book definition :
 The number of statements executed in the function for n elements of data is a function of the number of elements, expressed as f(n).
 We don't need to determine the complete measure of effeciency,only the factor that determines the magnitude.this factor is big-O
